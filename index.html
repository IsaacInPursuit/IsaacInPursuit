  <!-- About Me Section -->
  <section id="about">
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I’m Isaac Johnston, a soon to be graduate of UNC Charlotte with a background in Criminal Justice and Psychology. These fields have sharpened my ability to analyze complex situations, understand human behavior, and communicate effectively — skills that I now leverage to fuel my entrepreneurial journey.</p>
    <p>I firmly believe everyone has something valuable to teach and contribute, and I’m always eager to learn from those who’ve walked the path before me. Whether it’s wealth-building, investment strategies, or the complexities of real estate and finance, I’m committed to absorbing knowledge from all angles.</p>
    <p>Currently, I’m focused on securing a strategic role in real estate or finance to gain the expertise needed to scale my investments. Once I secure my first loan, my goal is to transition into more remote and flexible roles, giving me the time and freedom to focus on building my asset portfolio and generating passive income streams.</p>
